  from the CRAN HH_2.3-42, and scripts supporting the First Edition, continue
  to work.  New features are added.  The package is now supported only for R.
  Not all S-Plus specific contructions have been removed.

* ladder: no longer uses panel.cartesian.R and grid.axis.hh.R

* likert.formula: changes in rightAxis to rowSums are now correct in each panel.

* Fix up lots of .Rd files where the lines were too long, but not
  detected by R CMD check.

* Switch IMPORTS from reshape package to reshape2 package.
