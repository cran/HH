Version 3.0-5
-------------

* 2014 June 28

* Adjust ylim in demo(ancova)

* mmc (multicomp.reverse) warning() changed to cat().
  This is informative and does not require user action.
  It should appear at the place where the function is called.

* data(R282.y) now used in HH2 instead of data(R282).  For the second
  edition of HH, the dummy variables previously stored in R282 are now
  generated in the code.

* demo(betaWeightedAverage) added.

* added  RcmdrPlugin.HH to Suggests:

* corrected abline in plot.summaryHH.regsubsets

  R requires the a= argument, S-Plus acted as if the default was a=0.

  Old plotOddsRatio.base function returns OddsRatio(x, alpha[1]).

* resave crime.rda with names(dimnames())

Version 3.0-3
-------------

* 2014 February 5

* correct typo in plot.likert.formula

* document formula restriction in man/likert.Rd

* document placing x-axis labels on the top axis for horizontal likert plots

  likert plots and document it.

* restore old par.settings at the completion of
  panel.bwplot.intermediate.hh, remove S-Plus features.

* new argument width.cutoff in print.mmc.multicomp

* AElogrelrisk previously depended on the dataset being sorted
  order(PREF, RAND), but it wasn't documented.  logrelrisk had the
  same dependence and it was documented, but not enforced by the
  function.  Now both AElogrelrisk and logrelrisk do the ordering.
  The user no longer needs to worry about sort order.

* revised three demo files for better appearance of the plots.

* new function panel.bwplot.superpose

* published on CRAN 16-Feb-2014

* remove data files in text form and in S-Plus form

* fix typos in plot.multicomp.Rd mmc.Rd

Still needed
-------------

* Still needed: stop requiring dimnames in as.MatrixList.array (?).

* MMC rewritten in lattice: mmcplot, mmcmatch, mmcboth.
  Currently in separate mmcplot package

* HH2writing: hhpdf, hhdev.off, hhcapture need to be moved to HH as no-ops.
  Stangle.HH not needed in HH.
  Currently in separate HH2writing package

* new panel.bwplot.intermediate

* verify all scripts from First Edition


Version 3.0-1
-------------

* 2014 January 6

* direct copy of the unreleased HH_2.3-43

* The HH package is now at version 3.x-y to support the Second Edition
  of the HH book, Statistical Analysis and Data Display.  All examples
  from the CRAN HH_2.3-42, and scripts supporting the First Edition, continue
  to work.  New features are added.  The package is now supported only for R.
  Not all S-Plus specific contructions have been removed.

* ladder: no longer uses panel.cartesian.R and grid.axis.hh.R

* likert.formula: changes in rightAxis to rowSums are now correct in each panel.

* Fix up lots of .Rd files where the lines were too long, but not
  detected by R CMD check.

* Switch IMPORTS from reshape package to reshape2 package.
