\title{ Calculate the Variance Inflation Factor }
\description{
The VIF for predictor \eqn{i} is \eqn{1/(1-R_i^2)}, where \eqn{R_i^2} is the
\eqn{R^2} from a regression of predictor \eqn{i} against the remaining
predictors.
}
\usage{
vif(xx, ...)

\method{vif}{default}(xx, y.name, na.action = na.exclude, ...) ## xx is a data.frame

\method{vif}{formula}(xx, data, na.action = na.exclude, ...)   ## xx is a formula

\method{vif}{lm}(xx, na.action = na.exclude, ...)  ## xx is a "lm" object computed with x=TRUE
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{xx}{\code{data.frame}, or \code{formula}, or \code{lm} object
    computed with \code{x=TRUE}.}
  \item{na.action}{See
   \code{\link[stats]{na.action}}.
  }
  \item{\dots}{additional arguments. }

  \item{y.name}{Name of Y-variable to be excluded from the computations.}

  \item{data}{A data frame in which the variables specified in the
    formula will be found. If missing, the variables are searched for in
    the standard way. }

\details{
A simple diagnostic of collinearity is the
\emph{variance inflation factor, VIF}
one for each regression coefficient (other than the intercept).
Since the condition of collinearity involves the predictors but not
the response, this measure is a function of the \eqn{X}'s but not of \eqn{Y}.
The VIF for predictor \eqn{i} is \eqn{1/(1-R_i^2)}, where \eqn{R_i^2} is the
\eqn{R^2} from a regression of predictor \eqn{i} against the remaining
predictors.  If \eqn{R_i^2} is close to 1, this means that predictor \eqn{i}
is well explained by a linear function of the remaining predictors,
and, therefore, the presence of predictor \eqn{i} in the model is
redundant.  Values of VIF exceeding 5 are considered evidence of
collinearity: The information carried by a predictor having such a VIF
is contained in a subset of the remaining predictors.  If, however,
all of a model's regression coefficients differ significantly from 0
(\eqn{p}-value \eqn{<} .05), a somewhat larger VIF may be tolerable.
