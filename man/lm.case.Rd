\title{ case statistics for regression analysis}
\description{
  Case statistics for regression analysis.
  \code{case.lm} calculates the statistics.
  \code{plot.case} plots the cases, one statistic per panel, and
  illustrates and flags all observations for which the standard
  thresholds are exceeded.  \code{plot.case} returns an object with
  class \code{c("trellis.case", "trellis")}
  containing the plot and the row.names of the
  flagged observations.  The object is printed by a method which
  displays the set of graphs and prints the list of flagged cases.
  \code{panel.case} is a panel function for \code{plot.case}.

\arguments{

  \item{lms}{\code{summary.lm(fit)}}

%% plot.case
\item{x}{In \code{plot.case}, the matrix output from \code{case.lm}
  containing case diagnostics on each observation in the original
  dataset.
  In \code{panel.case}, the x variable to be plotted}
\item{which}{In \code{plot.case}, the names of the columns of x
  that are to be graphed.}
\item{between.in}{\code{between} trellis/lattice argument.}
%% \item{oma}{In S-Plus, change \code{par()$oma} to make room for the
%%   threshold values.  A warning is printed when  \code{par()$oma}
%%   is changed as the delayed printing of trellis objects implies we can't
%%   return it to the original value automatically.
%%   In R, this argument is ignored.  Instead, we use the
%%   \code{par.settings} argument to \code{xyplot} inside \code{plot.case}.
%%   The \code{par.settings} becomes one component of the \code{"trellis"}
%%   object that is the value of \code{plot.case} and is therefore
%%   automatically applied every time the object is printed.}
\item{cex.threshold}{Multiplier for \code{cex} for the threshold values.}
\item{main.in}{\code{main} title for \code{xyplot}. The default main title
  displays the linear model formula from \code{fit}.}
\item{sigma.in}{standard error for the \code{fit}.}
\item{p.in}{The number of degrees of freedom associated with the fitted
  model.}
%% \item{obs.large}{Object name where the names of
%%   all observations for which the standard
%%   thresholds are exceeded will be stored.  The default name is
%%   \code{.lm.case.large}.}
%% \item{obs.large.env}{Environment in
%%   R (defaults to \code{globalenv()}) where \code{.lm.case.large} will be stored.}
\item{main.cex}{\code{cex} for main title.}
\item{\dots}{other arguments to \code{xyplot}}

%% panel.case
 \item{y}{the y variable to be plotted.}
 \item{thresh}{Named list of lists.  Each list contains the components
 threshold ($y$-locations where a reference line will be drawn),
 thresh.label (the right-axis labels for the reference lines), thresh.id
 (the bounds defining "Noteworthy Observations").}
 \item{case.large}{Named list of "Noteworthy Observations".}
 \item{nn}{Number of rows in original dataset.}
 \item{pp}{The number of degrees of freedom associated with the fitted model.}
 \item{ss}{Standard error for the \code{fit}.}
 \item{subscripts}{trellis/lattice argument, position in the reshaped
   dataset constructed by \code{plot.case} before calling \code{xyplot}.}
 \item{rownames}{row name in the original data.frame.}
 \item{group.names}{names of the individual statistics.}
 %% \item{par.settings}{Used in R as part of the call to \code{xyplot}.
 %%   Although this argument is not used in the panel function,
 %%   it is needed as a formal argument in S-Plus to absorb it out of \code{\dots}
 %%   and thereby prevent it from being forwarded to \code{points}.}

\details{
\code{lm.influence} is part of S-Plus and R
\code{case.lm} and \code{plot.case} are based on:
Section 4.3.3 "Influence of Individual Obervations
in Chambers and Hastie", \emph{Statistical Models in S}.



}
\value{
  \code{case.lm} returns a matrix, with one row for each observation
  in the original dataset.  The columns contain the diagnostic statistics:
 \code{e} (residuals),
 \code{h}* (hat diagonals),
 \code{si}* (deleted standard deviation),
 \code{sta.res} (standardized residuals),
 \code{stu.res}* (Studentized deleted resididuals),
 \code{dffit} (difference in fits, change in predicted y when
 observation i is deleted),
 \code{dffits}* (standardized difference in fits, standardized change
 in predicted y when observation i is deleted),
 \code{cook}* (Cook's distance),
 and DFBETAs* (standardized difference in regression coefficients when
 observation i is deleted, one for each column of the x-matrix,
 including the intercept).


 \code{plot.case} returns a \code{c("trellis.case", "trellis")} object
  containing the plot
  (including the starred columns by default) and also retains the
  row.names of the flagged observations in the
  \code{$panel.args.common$case.large}
  component.  The print method for the \code{c("trellis.case",
    "trellis")}
  object prints the graph and the list of flagged observations.

  \code{panel.case} is a panel function for \code{plot.case}.
